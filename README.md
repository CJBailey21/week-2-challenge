# week-2-challenge
    My portfolio has a working nav bar with a title on the left side and the nav directory on the right side. There is an about me with a picture and a short about me. There is a section dedicated to completed work with hyperlinked images and titles for each one. While hovering over the images of the work, a shadow appears below it and the cursor changes to a pointer. The end of the page is a contact me hub with an email, phone number, and a link to my github.
